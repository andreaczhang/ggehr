> The package should demonstrate key concepts for a fundamental medical statistics curriculum. For the moment, use hypothesis testing (t-test, wilcoxon tests), correlation and 2b2 table analysis.

# Stage 1

Correlation (normal, skewed)

Statistical paradoxes (the later two relate to causal inf)

- (Accuracy paradox + prevalence * PPV: accuracy is not a good metric when it comes to imbalanced data; more false positives than true positives) sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic test
- Simpson's paradox
- Berkson's paradox

Hypothesis testing

- normal
- Skewed 
- comparison after transformation

Power and sample size 



2b2 table analysis: risk ratio vs odds ratio 





# Stage 2

Causal inference x regression (linear, logistic)

Mixed model 

Missing data

# Stage 3
